First you need to find list the numbers form least to greatest and then you need to find the median.
Then you need to find the median of the lower and upper quartiles which can be used to make the box. 
The median of all the numbers should be located in the box otherwise it has not been done correctly.
If there are 2 numbers in the middle, add both of them and divide by 2 to get your median.
